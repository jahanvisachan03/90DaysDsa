day 1:
date : 6 march 2022
today i learnt time complexity 
we have three different types of time complexity 
best case which is omega (1)
average case = theta(n+1)/2
worst case is O(n)

time complexiy is depend upon the input operation which we r going to perform.
mostly we took worst case 
so that we can find all solution and prepare them in systematic manner 

day 2 : 7 mar 22
today i learnt about stack 
stack is based on last in first out 
we have certain operation in stack 
like empty : which tells the stack is empty or not 
top : give u the first element of stack
size : size of the stack 
push() and pop() which is used to insert and delete the element from stack 

day 3 :
8 mar 22

feeling tired can't explain more btw i started reading a book which is quite good
may be i will get a big change in me after finishing of that book gn
