today i learnt time complexity 
we have three different types of time complexity 
best case which is omega (1)
average case = theta(n+1)/2
worst case is O(n)

time complexiy is depend upon the input operation which we r going to perform.
mostly we took worst case 
so that we can find all solution and prepare them in systematic manner
